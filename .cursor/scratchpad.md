*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ 95% confidence â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ Chain of thought analysis â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

Cross-reference with @memories.md, @lessons-learned.md, @project-requirements.md, docs/phases/PHASE-*.md files for context and best practices.`

# Mode: PLAN ðŸŽ¯
Current Task: Test project infrastructure setup workflow implementation

Understanding:
- Testing the new rules and workflow implementation
- Need to verify Mode System operation
- Need to test documentation protocols
- Need to validate task management system

Questions:
1. What type of project are we testing with? (Web/Mobile/Desktop)
2. Which specific infrastructure components should we test first?
3. What level of documentation depth should we demonstrate?
4. Should we simulate a complete project setup or focus on specific components?

Confidence: 65% (Need clarification on project type and scope)

Next Steps:
- Await clarification on project type
- Create test infrastructure components based on response
- Implement documentation standards
- Validate Mode System transitions
- Test memory and lessons learned integration
- Verify scratchpad management system

Current Phase: PHASE-TEST-WORKFLOW
Mode Context: Plan Mode
Status: Planning
Last Updated: v1.0.0

# Mode System Overview
Current Mode: Plan Mode (Read Only)

This scratchpad operates in two distinct modes:

1. **Plan Mode (Current - Read Only)**
   - Information gathering and solution architecture
   - Confidence assessment required (95% threshold)
   - No code modifications allowed
   - Focus on planning and validation

2. **Act Mode (Requires Activation)**
   - Activated by user typing "Act"
   - Enables code modifications
   - Requires completed planning phase
   - Implementation of approved plans

## Current Task: Authentication Implementation
Mode: PLAN MODE üîç

## Feature Requirements (Updated)
[X] Authentication with Google and Facebook integration
[X] Real-time functionality required
[X] Advanced but not overdone UI/UX
[X] Performance optimization priority
[ ] Determine optimal integration point in application

## Detailed Implementation Plan
1. Authentication Setup
   - Configure Next-Auth.js for authentication
   - Set up Google OAuth provider
   - Set up Facebook OAuth provider
   - Implement session management

2. UI/UX Components
   - Create modern authentication modal/page
   - Design responsive login buttons
   - Implement loading states
   - Add smooth transitions
   - Ensure mobile-first design

3. Performance Optimization
   - Implement lazy loading for auth components
   - Optimize authentication state management
   - Add proper error boundaries
   - Implement client-side validation

4. Real-time Features
   - Set up WebSocket connection for real-time status
   - Implement real-time session management
   - Add real-time validation feedback

5. Security Measures
   - Implement CSRF protection
   - Add rate limiting
   - Set up secure session management
   - Configure proper error handling

## Confidence Assessment
Current Confidence: 85% üìà
Remaining Questions:
1. Should this be implemented as a modal or dedicated page?
2. Do we need to handle existing user accounts?
3. What should be the session expiration time?

## Dependencies & Technical Stack
- Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- Next-Auth.js for authentication
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Socket.io/WebSocket for real-time features
- React Query for state management

## Progress Tracking
[X] Requirements gathering
[-] Technical design
[ ] Implementation plan approval
[ ] Development
[ ] Testing
[ ] Documentation

## Next Steps
1. Get approval on the implementation plan
2. Clarify remaining questions
3. Request switch to Act mode
4. Begin implementation phase

*Note: Confidence increased to 85% but still need clarification on integration specifics before reaching 95% threshold for Act Mode*

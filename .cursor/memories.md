*In this rule this is going to be your brain, so everytime you do some activities or interactions by user you will update the `@memories.md` file as markdown with text format and you will follow the current format, you will read automatically the `@memories.md` file on .cursor/ directory. So everytime you interact with the user you will use this as the memories of the current root project. If the `@memories.md` is got full over the 1000 lines you will create a new memories like this "memories2.md" file. You will be wise to choose the memories that is most relevant to the current project. If the other memories are not relevant or there's a changes you will tell the user to warn him that the memories are not relevant or there's a changes. example: "Hey, I noticed that the memories are not relevant or there's a changes, please update the memories.md file."*

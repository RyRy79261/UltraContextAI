# 🎯 AI Context Rules System

## 🌟 Quick Overview
A comprehensive system for managing AI interactions through memory management, lessons learned tracking, and dual-mode operation (Plan/Agent). This system ensures consistent, high-quality development while maintaining detailed project documentation and knowledge retention.

## 🔄 Core Components
1. **Memory System** (`@memories.md`)
   - Tracks all interactions chronologically
   - Auto-updates with timestamps and tags
   - Maintains project context and decisions
   - Uses version control format [v1.0.0]
   - Supports #tags for easy searching

2. **Lessons Learned** (`@lessons-learned.md`)
   - Captures solutions and best practices
   - Uses structured format: Issue → Solution → Impact
   - Categorizes by component, TypeScript, errors, etc.
   - Prioritizes issues (Critical/Important/Enhancement)
   - Links to related code examples

3. **Scratchpad** (`@scratchpad.md`)
   - Manages current phase and tasks
   - Tracks implementation progress
   - Uses clear status markers [X], [-], [ ], [!], [?]
   - Maintains task dependencies
   - Updates confidence metrics

## 🎯 Mode System Operation

### Plan Mode 🎯
```markdown
Trigger: "plan"
Purpose: Information gathering and planning
Requirements:
- Parse user input
- Cross-reference requirements
- Generate clarifying questions
- Calculate confidence score
- Create task breakdown
```

### Agent Mode ⚡
```markdown
Trigger: "agent"
Activation Requirements:
- 95% confidence level
- All questions answered
- Tasks defined
- No blocking issues
- Requirements verified
```

## 🚀 Workflow Steps

1. **Initialize Planning** 🎯
   ```markdown
   - Use "plan" trigger
   - System creates new scratchpad entry
   - Generates minimum 3 questions
   - Sets initial confidence score
   ```

2. **Build Confidence** 📈
   ```markdown
   - Answer all questions
   - Verify requirements
   - Update task dependencies
   - Monitor confidence score
   ```

3. **Execute Implementation** ⚡
   ```markdown
   - Reach 95% confidence
   - Use "agent" trigger
   - System implements solution
   - Updates documentation
   ```

## 🎮 Workflow Example

### Example 1: Creating a New Feature 🛠️

1. **User Request**:
   ```markdown
   User: "Let's create a new Button component with variants"
   ```

2. **Plan Mode Activation** 🎯
   ```markdown
   AI: "Entering Plan Mode..."

   # Mode: PLAN 🎯
   Current Task: Create Button component with variants

   Understanding:
   - Need to implement Button component
   - Requires variant support
   - Must follow accessibility standards

   Questions:
   1. Which variants are needed? (primary/secondary/outline?)
   2. What sizes should be supported?
   3. Should we include icon support?

   Confidence: 65% (Need variant specifications)
   ```

3. **User Clarification**:
   ```markdown
   User: "We need primary, secondary, outline variants, and sm/md/lg sizes"

   AI: "Updating understanding..."
   - Variants: primary, secondary, outline
   - Sizes: sm, md, lg
   - Adding to requirements

   Confidence: 95% (Requirements clear)
   ```

4. **Agent Mode Transition** ⚡
   ```markdown
   AI: "Requirements met, entering Agent Mode..."

   Implementation:
   1. Creating Button component
   2. Adding variants and sizes
   3. Implementing accessibility
   4. Updating documentation
   ```

5. **Real-time Updates**:
   ```markdown
   @memories.md:
   [2024-03-21 15:00] Development: Implemented Button component with primary/secondary/outline variants, size options (sm/md/lg), and full accessibility support. #feature

   @lessons-learned.md:
   [2024-03-21 15:00] Component Development:
   Issue: Button variants need consistent styling
   Solution: Implemented CSS variable system
   Why: Ensures theme consistency
   ```

### Example 2: Bug Fix Workflow 🐛

1. **User Report**:
   ```markdown
   User: "The DatePicker isn't working with form validation"
   ```

2. **Plan Mode Analysis** 🎯
   ```markdown
   # Mode: PLAN 🎯
   Current Task: Fix DatePicker form validation

   Understanding:
   - DatePicker has validation issues
   - Need to investigate form integration

   Questions:
   1. What validation library is being used?
   2. Are there console errors?
   3. Which form scenarios fail?

   Confidence: 45% (Need more details)
   ```

3. **Investigation Process**:
   ```markdown
   AI: "Investigating..."
   - Checking component code
   - Reviewing form integration
   - Testing validation scenarios

   Found Issue: Type mismatch between DatePicker output and form expectations
   Confidence: 95% (Root cause identified)
   ```

4. **Solution Implementation** ⚡
   ```markdown
   AI: "Implementing fix..."
   1. Updating type definitions
   2. Adding value transformation
   3. Testing form scenarios
   4. Updating documentation
   ```

5. **Documentation Updates**:
   ```markdown
   @memories.md:
   [2024-03-21 15:30] Bug Fix: Resolved DatePicker form validation issue by implementing proper type transformation and updating integration docs. #bug

   @lessons-learned.md:
   [2024-03-21 15:30] Form Integration:
   Issue: DatePicker value format inconsistency
   Solution: Added value transformer
   Why: Ensures consistent form data handling
   ```

These examples demonstrate:
- Mode transitions (Plan 🎯 → Agent ⚡)
- Confidence building process
- Documentation updates
- Memory and lesson tracking
- Real-time progress monitoring

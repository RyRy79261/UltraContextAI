`Project Requirements rules *@docs/project-requirements.md* You will use tools codebase to know what are the details of the files of this *@docs/project-requirements.md* directory files to check the project requirements and the project standards that you need to follow. This will be the guide for you to make sure you are following the project standards. So make sure to read this when planning and implementing the project to avoid duplications, conflicts, and errors. Don't touch that folder and files, you will only read it. Don't over do it to the point that you are not following the project requirements. DON'T REMOVE THIS LINE 1!!!!`
